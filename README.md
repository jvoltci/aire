# aire
A smart polling system.
<br>
<br>
<i>aire is polling and survey system for those who want the quick result and feedback over a particular local region. I made this app seeing the gap here in my college. It becomes hectic to take a survey or feedback on an issue so to simplify this process or just to air this problem I cameÂ up with "aire".</i>
